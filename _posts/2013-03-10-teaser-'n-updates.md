Hey there! That's a teaser picture of Raelum Skywatchers that showcases some assets that are used in the game. So if you've read our earlier blog entries, you would know that this is a cannonball physics game and there are objects in the air that you can interact with. So the goo, bomb, cannon, and secret spaceship can be found during flight and the glider, swords, and guns are equipment that you can buy from the shop! You also get a sneak peak of the first map which is the hometown of the main character. Hope you're excited for the game's release! I know we are! ðŸ˜€
