So do you see a familiar sight? This is the improved side-scroller type game made on Flash and now on Unity! The prototype is supposed to be for a side-scroller parkour-type game and this idea was conceived because we needed an easy game to make while being fun at the same time. The hardest part for us is to actually get good assets to use for games to be attractive. Too bad we aren't artists... But at least we can still make shapes in Unity so... a capsule sliding on random shapes is all we can come up with? Nahh... we abandoned this project just because we didn't think it had much potential.

The whole experience with Unity is amazing though compared to Flash. It feels more fitting for a game developer than Flash which can be appointed as an animation and design tool. We are thinking of making a game on Unity... just thinking... no spoilers though.
