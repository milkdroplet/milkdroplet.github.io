Just some more updates on our game. Currently this is the physics of the game and the clouds are either obstacles or benefits. Pressing the space bar to select angle and power and left and right arrow keys for rotation. After launch, pressing the space bar would be using boosters and boosters use fuel. The HUD is currently text showing amount of fuel left, altitude, velocity, and distance travelled. We're also trying to implement glider physics and the character loses the glider when they land, but they can continue bouncing or sliding. The background city image is used to test the looping of the background which we will in the future create stage map backgrounds.
