A blast into our past of working on Raelum Skywatchers in the early days. So as you can see, the cannon and the first version of the cat were drawn on paper and scanned into the computer and then traced with the line tool on Flash, then coloured in. The cannon head had to be a separate piece from the body because in the game, the cannon head's angle constantly rotated up and down. This was so when the cat goes inside the cannon during flight, the cannon would rotate and point towards the direction of flight that the cat would launch. So the cat's three stages of drawings can be seen from a screenshot of the stage. So after tracing the hand-drawn image, it was actually our first time working with the line tool so it left a good impression after seeing how nice it looks compared to on paper. It's always good to reflect on the past once in a while and see how far you've come. For us, it's been a tremendously long journey making Raelum Skywatchers. And it's been a blast!
