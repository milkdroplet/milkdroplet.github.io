The time has finally come. After months of *cough* hard work *cough* the game is almost complete and the trailer has been released. This is our studio debut game and we hope to finish this game as soon as possible for people to play. Raelum Skywatchers is a simple cannonball physics game where you will play as a cat and train yourself to be in the class of elite cats. With the "help" of an uber buffed up cat, you will reveal your inner potential and fly like no kitty has done before. For some reason, random objects are in the air as you fly so that makes it a bit interesting.
