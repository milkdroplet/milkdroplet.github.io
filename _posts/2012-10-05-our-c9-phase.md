So. What is so interesting about this screenshot you may ask? This is a game called C9 and we were addicted to this game with our friends. Yes this moment in our freshman year of university was used to play games. We sort of went through a mental breakdown at one point trying to balance between school work and MD so we just took a break from MD to replenish ourselves a bit. So instead of doing development, we did a bit of "market research". We got pretty far. A guild was made with around 60 members and we were the leaders, we were fully indulged. From working on games for MD, we have experienced ups and downs. We remember the downs more than the ups of course being human. But the force that drove us to continue was the same force that drove us to create MD in the first place. And playing C9 was a reminder of what we were striving to achieve.
