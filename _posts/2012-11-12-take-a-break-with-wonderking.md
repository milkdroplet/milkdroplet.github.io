Another game? You bet. This game is called WonderKing and if you were a MapleStory fan like we were, you would've liked this game. This was like a gaming period for us to just relax for a bit and enjoy the MD stress-free life y'know?

But, guessing it really got to us when we were developing for the current game we're trying to release. We can't recall how many days we stayed up and were sleep-deprived because of MD and how many days we would just spend over 20 hours working on MD. It's quite a stressful experience. Even at the expense of academic success we would say.

Of course chasing our dreams are what we deem the most important, but we tend to be so focused on it that we forget what we should immediately attend to, for instance, our health. For some time, we worked because we enjoyed doing what we do and had fun while doing it. But sometimes even when developing a game that you pride yourself in and absolutely love it, there are always some dark areas that we dislike. There's a point where the enjoyment of development of a game turns into actual work and feels like doing an assignment or school project that you don't really care about.

When that point comes, you know that the game has dragged on for too long and has lost your interest. We can both agree at this point, we just want to get the game over with, but at the same time, we are proud and happy that every day we are working closer to our dream. So sometimes, even though something is important to you, you shouldn't sacrifice other things that are necessary, otherwise it really messes with your concentration and morale.

Take a break when necessary. Read a book, watch anime, play games, go out with friends, chill with the fam jam, learn an instrument, get out and do something other than work. That's first-hand experience advice that we stand by. Who knows, maybe you'll be happier in the end when you do achieve your goals that you weren't a blind fool while doing it.
