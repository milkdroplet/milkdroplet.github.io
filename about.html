<p>We're just some guys that followed our dreams of delivering games to the world one step at a time. We're small right now, but we hope on becoming a group of individuals that strive to drop fun into people's lives with the games that we make. Being video game enthusiasts at a young age, we found that the enjoyment and happiness we got while playing games were unrivaled by any other sources of entertainment. We would like others to experience what we have experienced in the past and this is why we put our minds together to create things that are memorable. A single drop was the start to a grand ocean of opportunity.</p>
