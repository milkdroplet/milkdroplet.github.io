We're going to have to flag this as 18+, funny thing is we're not 18 yet! Haha... hah... Anyways, this was our attempt at creating our own character model. As you can see, this was going to be a test female character made using two perspective drawings. After about the time we took the screenshot, we realized just how hard the task was going to be to model and animate 3D characters.

Yeah we should've thought ahead... But this made us realize how difficult it was going to be in terms of art and modelling. I think we could have a shot at the programming though, or so we think. Let's see if we could make this work using block figures instead. Brb.
