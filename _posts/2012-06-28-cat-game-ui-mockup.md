Alright so this is the first UI representation of our game! We know how it looks, it looks crappy for now, but it'll get better. So the game is centered around a cat that is flying through the air to different places. There are different stages that the cat has to fly to. The distance travelled will unlock the next stage and so on. So for this game, we divided the work so that one person worked on the in-game flight mechanics and the other person worked on UI and linking everything together.

As you can see in credits, we had a friend do some mockups for the characters in the game and they were great! Unfortunately, things didn't work out and we parted ways. We are actually actively looking for an artist after realizing just how scarce and important they really are in the game industry.
