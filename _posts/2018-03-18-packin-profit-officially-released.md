# Releasing of the best game ever! (in our opinion) #

This. Game. Is. Finally. Coming. Out. What has been in the works for almost an eternity is now released to the public!

Packin' Profit is a factory-based simulation game where you get to play as the manager of a factory and can control the fate of your business with the tip of your finger, quite literally.

Check out the trailer!

The interface of the game is simple and reminiscent of the classic upgrade game style featuring an upgrade menu navigation bar at the bottom of the screen which pops up an upgrade menu when a menu selected.
You can then buy any upgrades you wish from the upgrade menus.

There are many factors that affect income and each of those factors are represented in the upgrade menus.
The two main ways to earn money through interaction is swiping downwards on a box to sell the box and packing the box by tapping or holding
down on the box. When packing the box, you'll notice cute looking objects being put in boxes that normally would not be in there! But that's how you make money so forget logic for now.

Along with offline, passive, and direct income, there is also a time for when rush hour happens. This is when you and your workers are most efficient and can increase all income sources by a drastic amount!
And you can get gifts randomly to motivate you along in your packing adventures. Were you also ever wondering about what the names of super large numbers are in English? Well wonder no longer cause we help you
learn with a list of them!
