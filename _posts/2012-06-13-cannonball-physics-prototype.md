After the end of the last Unity project, we decided to really focus on completing something and that was going to be released. I bet you guys forgot that we were working on a flash game all this time as well. Well all our planning has been done and we're starting to program the game. So the attached mini-game you see is the base of our new game idea. Pressing the space bar will select the angle and power at launch.

That's right. It's going to be a cannonball physics game inspired by so many great flash games already made. We know that there are a lot of games like this out there, but what we also know is that we had a lot of fun playing them. And that's why even though the idea wasn't original for the mechanics, we wanted people to have fun and that was all.
