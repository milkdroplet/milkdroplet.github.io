How do you like our paper and pencil sketches? So we are showcasing a buff cat, a shop owner with a stand, and a scene in the introduction story.

We're not professional artists or anything, but we spent quite some time learning how to make vector images and how everything worked in the realm of shapes and objects in Flash. We sketched on paper and scanned the copy in and put the picture into Flash on a trace layer so we can just use the line tool and curve them with the selection tool to match what was on the drawing. That took quite some time to understand and learn, but the vectorized and coloured images are shown as well. Hard work pays off in the end! ðŸ˜€
