So after days of trying to make something animate in 3D, we came up with a walking animation of a block character model and a walking one where the model's arm is rotating in an ellipse. The plan was for the character to have a weapon held and rotating with movement from the mouse. After creating this animation, a lot of thoughts came into our heads.

For this project, we recruited some high school friends of whom only three of us were doing the majority of the work. This was not going to turn out well since only the minority of the group was motivated enough to work on this side-project. The truth was right in front of us and we knew it around this time. This project wasn't feasible and there's no way we would complete it given the skills we had and the resources that we lacked.

Another project going downhill. I guess this is how it is though right? We surely must anticipate the chance of failure. But at this rate, how long will it be before we can exact our ambitions, the reason we got together to do this in the first place?
