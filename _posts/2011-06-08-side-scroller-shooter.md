Welcome! So combining all we've learned from the maze game and the side-scroller, we made a simple pong game! It's complete in its basic form and we also experimented with a very simple AI as well as a glare animation on text. Controls are only the left and right arrow keys. Also we put in a sound clip so the game sounds as fun as it looks!

Ironically for the text we put "Experience The Fun" even though we realize very much so that this is a dull and boring game. We put "MilkDroplet" as a fun label for the stuff we create so it's like we're signing the things we make, y'know? We have an ambition for making fun games that people will enjoy not only as a pastime, but religiously. Like how we grew up being obsessed playing MapleStory, we want to inspire and influence people like how that game did us.

In order to do that, we have to start somewhere right? I think under the name "MilkDroplet" sounds a bit silly compared to "Nexon", but how it came to be was just a combination of our in-game names for GunZ. By combining both our igns, "LittleMiIk" (notice the I) and "Droplet", we made "MilkDroplet". This will have to do for now in terms of naming, we might change it in the future when we have time. For now, please try very hard to enjoy the pong game!
