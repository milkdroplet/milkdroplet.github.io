What?!?! A blog post not about games?!?! That's right. This blog post is to talk about the start of our university careers at the University of Waterloo. Quite famous in Canada for their nerdiness. Anyways, the two of us have been planning to attend UW ever since the 10th grade. We heard of their notorious co-op program back then and were really serious about our university applications and even back then we knew what we wanted to do.

So we were allowed to choose three universities for free and being as cheap as we are, we only applied to three (there was a fee for more apps). Anyways, we applied to the same universities as each other, University of Waterloo (UW), University of Toronto (UofT), University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT). We were quite worried to see which one we would get rejected by, but we were worried for nothing because we both got early acceptances for all the above institutions.

Before knowing about UW, UofT was the goal for everyone that resided in Toronto or internationally for that matter since they're that renowned. It was the goal for us too before we knew what was better for our careers in the end. Choosing UW will allow us to graduate in 4 years and 8 months for our undergraduate whereas if we went to UofT, we would graduate in 4 years. BUT. Going with UW will give us 6 co-op/internship terms that are 4 months long each. This means upon graduating, we would already have two years of work experience.

So of course we went with UW. But today, we start our journey in university. We don't know what will happen with MilkDroplet (MD), but we will carry it as far as our ambitions extend. For the couple of you out there, thanks for reading and following our adventure. :)
