Hey there! So we're currently finishing up some final touches to the game. We thought between two options of teaching players how to play the game. So the first option is a traditional instructions page and the second option is an interactive tutorial in the game when you first reach a certain screen in the game.

So there are pros and cons to both of these. The instructions page is "out-of-style" and the interactive tutorial could be quite annoying to the players that they are forced to see it. So we found a compromise between the traditional instructions page and an interactive tutorial. Currently trying to implement this along with some regression testing so hopefully we can release the game soon!
