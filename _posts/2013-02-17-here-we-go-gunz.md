GUNZ!!! We always go back to these nostalgic games because it really shows us our roots and how MilkDroplet really came about. The naming of MD was a combination of our in-game names in GunZ just in case you're wondering about the unique name. So we've got to say that we were pretty "pro" at the game, we were both gladiators meaning we mostly did swordplay.

It's a shame that games are becoming less about the social aspect and start getting competitive. We remember when the community was the reason why we played games and kept us on. One of us even played for years just because of the people that played and the social aspect and not so much the game itself.

We want to bring that back. It's one of the things we dream about. When we could create a community again. A real one. One where people won't be harassed just because they are new players. One where players rely on teamwork and communication to prevail. One where fun does not equate competitive edge fueled by a numbers game, but the happiness one receives from being a part of a world that's exciting, filled with laughter, peaceful, funny. A world where one could escape the realities of the present and its depression is a world that we would like to create.

Sounds a bit intense ehh? We know what most people would think. "It's impossible. You guys are crazy! Get a real dream! You'll never achieve that! Are you delusional?" The moment we succumb to these thoughts is the moment we don't deserve the dream that we laid out for ourselves. When we doubt, that's the end of it. Other people can doubt us, but we can never break. We know it's a pretty hard goal to achieve. But if it's not a hard or impossible feat then we wouldn't be trying to achieve it. Let's see where this takes us and let these blogs hold our memories and struggles towards our aspiration.
