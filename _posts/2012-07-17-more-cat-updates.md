OMG! The main character is there! Or at least that's the asset for now... So the cloud assets have also been updated, but overall it has the same controls as posted in an early blog. We also improved on the bounciness factor so literally if you're lucky enough, you could be bouncing on clouds for a while.

The game is coming together though. Finally we can release something for once. At least we're hoping to release this after coming so far... Right! Positive thinking! The art is being done completely by us so it may be lacking in that department, but hopefully there won't be too harsh of a criticism.
