# Calm down, it's just a phase! #

There's this time in everyone's lives where we go through a phase of some sort. It can seem confusing with all the possible pathways and nobody to lead you in the right direction. It can be analogous to a maze. Hmm...

**WELL THAT'S WHAT THIS IS FOLKS!!!**

Do you like to phase through mazes like a hacker? Ever wanted to play a game so easy that it's basically idling? Well who wouldn't?! That's not what this game is about though. This game requires actual hard work. No shortcuts. Use the finger of your choice that you won't mind getting cramps from and control your player to finish each and every maze in each and every stage in the game!

Feast your eyes!

Wow! Much graphics! Such good!

Filled with the simplest and easy on the eyes graphics, this game is a whole class on its own. You may think it's very easy looking at these screenshots below, but let's just say you wouldn't be able to put a finger on just how difficult this game will be. So breeze through while it lasts, the road yonder lies a *wall* of evil.

You can download the game by clicking the on image below. Any tips? Well... Be sure to use your favourite and most dexterous finger and open up your eyes very wide. There's another sense that you must have to succeed at this game. Fair warning: the hand-eye coordination required to beat some mazes might result in mild seizures. And... Oh yeah. If you play this game in public, people might think you're a crazy person drawing ferociously on your device just like your rehab officer told you to do to relieve the stress of everyday life.
