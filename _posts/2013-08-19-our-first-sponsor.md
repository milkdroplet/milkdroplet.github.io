<p>HELLO!!! Thanks for reading in! So just some updates on our end, we got a sponsor for Raelum Skywatchers and have been working with them to improve the game. This picture was a screenshot of our original game menu screen before we decided to make a less-plain version since there were complaints from some people. Overall everything has been moving smoothly and the game is basically complete excluding some minor UI tweaks and some testing. We often wonder who actually follows our blogs and reads what we have to say. Probably not many people. It seems like we can just get away with writing anything because nobody reads what we have to say. Like, we are the best! And our games decrease obesity rates all over the world because they forget to feed themselves with actual food and only feed their lust for amazingly developed games. Yeah, but we do hope that you've enjoyed reading about our lives as guys that are just trying to do something good for the world. For those of you out there that are reading this, thanks for increasing our site traffic and every bit of support counts. Though, we need only our willpower, your support means at least we are making someone's day by using hundreds of ours.</p>

<p>TL;DR: You're the best cause you think we're the best! Thanks for your undivided encouragement! :)</p>
