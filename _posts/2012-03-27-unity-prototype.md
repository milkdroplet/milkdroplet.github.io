This is the great reveal to our game prototype for Unity! Or at least so we thought... again... The intention of this game was for a ninja jumping wall-to-wall sort of game. Ninja goes higher and higher and gets a higher score like that. Turns out it was too time-consuming to do on Unity. Feels like we're not yet experienced enough to fully know how to efficiently work in Unity. Some more investigation work is required on our part.

We really like how Unity helps with their added physics engine and collision work, though again, we weren't able to fully make use of everything Unity provides. So because the project doesn't have much potential, we're putting it on hold for now. Maybe working on projects with more people than just the two of us will help?
