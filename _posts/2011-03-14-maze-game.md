Welcome to the **first** blog post ever on this site!

For this post, we decided to introduce our progress in learning how to make games. We are using Flash to experiment and made a simple maze game where we learned how to switch from one screen (the menu) to another screen (the game). This switching is invoked by the click of a button in which there is an event handler to trigger it. So inside the game, you have to reach the dot without touching the walls otherwise you lose. We also made use of an event handler for every time the mouse moves and we make a hit test to see if the blue parts intersect with the mouse position, if it does then you lose the game.

One cheat to this is right clicking and just moving your mouse to the red dot and you get an easy win like that. We didn't decide to go into too much detail trying to prevent the cheat. We will be doing more learning about Flash for the next while so let's start our journey here.
