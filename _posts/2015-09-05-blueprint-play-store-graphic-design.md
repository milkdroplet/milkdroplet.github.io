Hey folks, we've been pretty busy with our lives for the last couple months and we are around 90% done our current game! This is the sneak peak graphic banner that will appear in the mobile app store and we've taken the initiative to censor out the title of the game just because we don't want anybody fainting from excitement. ðŸ˜›

We're planning the release onto Android and if it's successful then we'll be porting it over to iOS. So the theme of the game is a factory-based idle game where you can earn money by selling the boxes that you pack items up with. That's as simple as it gets. Live the life of a factory worker and make some big bucks.

The release is scheduled sometime in October or November this year, but we know how planning release dates go in the software world. It kind of stretches a bit further than scheduled, but we'll try our best to fulfill our own deadlines! Have fun with other peoples' games until then because when this game comes out, you won't play other peoples' games anymore! ðŸ˜€
