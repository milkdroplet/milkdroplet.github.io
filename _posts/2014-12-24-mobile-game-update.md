Hello again! Some quick updates here on our new game. So we've implemented some UI since our last blog post and there's an upgrade screen now with some money UI and current and next block UI. There's also a passive income text that shows how much money you get per second. You guessed it. This game of ours' is an idle game much like cookie clicker or make it rain. We've been having quite some trouble with optimizations for mobile and figuring out some alternative UI designs.

For now, we'll continue going as we've planned from the beginning and create assets. We've gotten better with asset creation since our last game so at least the assets this time will be fairly decent. No promises though. Stay tuned with our next update on the game!
