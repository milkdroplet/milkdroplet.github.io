Hello! So another blog post complaining about the complications of our lives... yay! So we got a group together to try to make a game set in the medieval times where skill is heavily required. Also we experimented with 3DS Max for creating 3D models because of this project. So yes! This game we're thinking of making is a full-out 3D game. Though we do have doubts on how far we can actually get, let's not mind that and challenge ourselves!

So the screenshot shows a man with a messed up right arm and chest and the backside of a cat model in the distance. So the cat was created in-house, but the man was a character model that was borrowed. So firstly, we wanted to test character movement so we moved the man's arm according to the mouse and placed the cat where the mouse pointed to. So the task was finished, but the scene was unsightly with the man's chest just popping out of place like that. Anyways, another successful step for us!
