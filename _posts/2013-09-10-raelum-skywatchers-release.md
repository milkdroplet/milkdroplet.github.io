After an unintended delay, we have finally released Raelum Skywatchers to the public. So far, we've been monitoring the game's ratings and it's been pretty good for a first game. Having an average rating of around 3 out of 5, we'd say we reached our goals as of now. Balancing our time to commit to making new games will be a great challenge for us since we are only developing games part-time. Though we believe that we will still be able to introduce a new game after this one. This has been a great learning experience for us. Starting from knowing nothing about flash to...well...knowing some more to flash. Since we started developing the game whilst learning about flash, we came across more efficient and organized ways to code the game. When design patterns and the "proper way" to code were introduced to us, we were already done coding most of the game in a very ugly fashion. We will, of course, learn from our ways and make sure that the next game we build will be beyond the constructs of perfection.

We have already started the preliminary steps to making our next game and we decided that we will use Unity3D instead of flash. This next game of ours will be more focused on the mobile game market. We are constantly trying to improve our games and exploring a new market will help us gain the experience we need for evolution. For whoever is out there reading this, we accept constructive criticism and we hope that if you enjoyed our game then please have some patience for our next development. We are fully aware that the release of an already completed game took around 4 months to do and this is because of our stressful schedule at our university where every four months we are either in a study semester or at a co-operative placement. So this means there are no break time for us other than weekends and the occasional after classes or work schedules. We will still try to allocate some/most of our free time into development for the next project at hand, but, once in a while, we believe some rest will be perfect to replenish us from having too much fun coding!

Stay tuned for any new updates pertaining to the next game and enjoy Raelum Skywatchers for the time being!
