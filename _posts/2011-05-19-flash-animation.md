After some more exploration, we went into seeing how Flash does animations. This was inspired from some YouTube videos that showed people animating stick figure fights and thought it'll be cool to investigate into it further.

So basically we used the onion skin function to edit every frame and then we noticed that we're trying to animate a stick figure walking so there's not a lot of ways to show the arms actually swinging. We then colour-coded the stickman's hands so it's easier to see the movement of the arms.

For a first animation I think we did decently and we got to learn more about frame rates and how to properly use the Flash environment to make edits and drawings. I think enough artsy stuff for now and it's time to dive into making some games. See you next time!
