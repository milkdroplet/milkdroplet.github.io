What's up peeps? We've been on hiatus for a **loooooong** time now, at least in terms of blog posts, but we haven't been lazy!. So all this time we've been doing lots of experimenting and learning and having sleepless nights because....... we were making a legit flash game! That's right! The word is out that MilkDroplet is going to release their first game! The plan is to put the game on Flash Game License to make some money from our hard work.

Let's not hype our game too much, we're actually only on the design stage, but we've learned a lot about Flash to the point where we're comfortable making a rather large first game. But while we have that going on, we were experimenting again with tools to make games and one of them is the Unity game engine.

We made this spaceship game prototype just to test movement and collision in Unity in hopes of finding a future platform for our games. Honestly Unity was a lot different from Flash in that it was a lot to take in at once. But knowing that 3D games could be made with Unity just boosted our motivation levels above their peaks. We'll be blogging about our Unity findings while designing our flash game at the same time. See you next time!
